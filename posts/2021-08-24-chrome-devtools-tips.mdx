DevTools are an invaluable part of an web engineers toolkit. Here's a few things that you might not have known.

## 1) Full page screenshots

You can capture a screenshot of a specific node. Just select the element, hit 'cmd+shift+p', and type 'capture node screenshot'

## 4) CSS shortcuts

Trying to work out where an element is inheriting a particular style from? Use the 'computed' style tab to view the properties that are rendered along with a link to what selector is adding that property.
