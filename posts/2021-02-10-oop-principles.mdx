Java is fundamentally an object-oriented programming (OOP) language. Let's explore the four main principles of OOP in Java:

## Encapsulation

Encapsulation is the bundling of data and the methods that operate on that data within a single unit (class). It's like putting related things in a box and controlling access to that box

``` 
public class Employee {
    private String name;
    private int age;

    public String getName() {
        return name;
    }

    public void setName(String name) {
        this.name = name;
    }

    public int getAge() {
        return age;
    }

    public void setAge(int age) {
        if (age > 0 && age < 120) {
            this.age = age;
        } else {
            throw new IllegalArgumentException("Invalid age");
        }
    }
}

 ```

In this example, name and age are private, and we control access to them through public methods.

## Inheritance

Inheritance allows a class to inherit properties and methods from another class. It's like passing traits from parents to children.

```
public class Animal {
    protected String name;

    public void eat() {
        System.out.println(name + " is eating");
    }
}

public class Dog extends Animal {
    public Dog(String name) {
        this.name = name;
    }

    public void bark() {
        System.out.println(name + " is barking");
    }
}
 ```

 Here, Dog inherits from Animal, gaining its properties and methods.


## Polymorphism

Polymorphism allows objects of different types to be treated as objects of a common base class. It's like having a remote control that works for different types of TVs.

```
public abstract class Shape {
    public abstract double area();
}

public class Circle extends Shape {
    private double radius;

    public Circle(double radius) {
        this.radius = radius;
    }

    @Override
    public double area() {
        return Math.PI * radius * radius;
    }
}

public class Rectangle extends Shape {
    private double width;
    private double height;

    public Rectangle(double width, double height) {
        this.width = width;
        this.height = height;
    }

    @Override
    public double area() {
        return width * height;
    }
}

// Usage
Shape circle = new Circle(5);
Shape rectangle = new Rectangle(4, 6);
System.out.println("Circle area: " + circle.area());
System.out.println("Rectangle area: " + rectangle.area());

```

Both Circle and Rectangle can be treated as Shape objects, but they behave differently when area() is called.

## Abstraction

Abstraction is the process of hiding implementation details and showing only the functionality to the user. It's like driving a car without needing to know how the engine works.

```
public interface DatabaseConnection {
    void connect();
    void disconnect();
    void executeQuery(String query);
}

public class MySQLConnection implements DatabaseConnection {
    @Override
    public void connect() {
        System.out.println("Connecting to MySQL database");
    }

    @Override
    public void disconnect() {
        System.out.println("Disconnecting from MySQL database");
    }

    @Override
    public void executeQuery(String query) {
        System.out.println("Executing query in MySQL: " + query);
    }
}

```
The DatabaseConnection interface abstracts the idea of a database connection, while MySQLConnection provides a specific implementation.
