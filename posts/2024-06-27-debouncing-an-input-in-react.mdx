summary: A quick approach to debouncing an input in React and Typescript.

I was recently building a search component in React that required debouncing an input element.

In the past when I've needed this pattern, I've used libraries like [lodash](https://lodash.com/), however I never really stopped to think about what's actually happening under the hood.

This article is mostly for my own reference to understand the concept, but I hope it's helpful to you as well.

## What is debouncing?

Debouncing is a technique used to limit the rate at which a function is called. It's often used in scenarios where a function is called multiple times in quick succession, but you only want to run it once after a certain period of time has passed.

For example, I was building a search component that would make an API request every time the user typed in a character. This could (and did) lead to a lot of unnecessary API requests. Debouncing the input would ensure that the API request only fired after the user had stopped typing for a certain period of time.

<SearchInput />

In the example above, I've replaced the API request with a simple filter to demonstrate the concept.

```tsx
const SearchInput = () => {
  const [searchTerm, setSearchTerm] = useState('');
  const [filteredData, setFilteredData] = useState(fakeData);

  useEffect(() => {
    if (searchTerm === '') {
      setFilteredData(fakeData);
      return;
    }

    setFilteredData(fakeData.filter((item) => item.title.includes(searchTerm)));
  }, [searchTerm]);

  const handleChange = (event: React.ChangeEvent<HTMLInputElement>) => {
    setSearchTerm(event.target.value);
  };

  return (
    <div className="w-full px-4 py-7 bg-stone-200 rounded-md flex flex-col gap-4">
      <input
        type="text"
        value={searchTerm}
        onChange={handleChange}
        placeholder="Search animals..."
      />
      <ul>
        {filteredData.map((item) => {
          return (
            <li key={item.id} className="text-stone-800">
              {item.title}
            </li>
          );
        })}
      </ul>
    </div>
  );
};
```

## Debouncing an input in React

Now let's look at that same example, but with the input debounced.

<DebouncedSearchInput />

```tsx
const SearchInput = () => {
  const [searchTerm, setSearchTerm] = useState('');
  const [filteredData, setFilteredData] = useState(fakeData);

  useEffect(() => {
    const timer = setTimeout(() => {
      if (searchTerm === '') {
        setFilteredData(fakeData);
        return;
      }

      setFilteredData(
        fakeData.filter((item) => item.title.includes(searchTerm))
      );
    }, 500);

    return () => clearTimeout(timer);
  }, [searchTerm]);

  const handleChange = (event: React.ChangeEvent<HTMLInputElement>) => {
    setSearchTerm(event.target.value);
  };

  return (
    <div className="w-full px-4 py-7 bg-stone-200 rounded-md flex flex-col gap-4">
      <input
        type="text"
        value={searchTerm}
        onChange={handleChange}
        placeholder="Search animals..."
      />
      <ul>
        {filteredData.map((item) => {
          return (
            <li key={item.id} className="text-stone-800">
              {item.title}
            </li>
          );
        })}
      </ul>
    </div>
  );
};
```

## So what's different?

The main differences are in the useEffect hook. Our logic to filter the data is now wrapped in a `setTimeout` function that delays the execution by 500ms.

Everytime the user types, the `useEffect` hook is called, but the `setTimeout` function is cleared and reset. This means that the function will only run once the user has stopped typing for 500ms.
